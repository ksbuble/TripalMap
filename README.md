# TripalMap

TripalMap is a Drupal module that provides interactive visualization of genetic maps.
The TripalMap module extends the Tripal suite of Drupal modules and can be added to any 
website that uses Tripal, where genetic map visualization functionality is desired.

Representing the next generation of the existing CMap tool, TripalMap is a browser based
tool for visualizing comparison of genetic maps from numerous species, and curating
map data. 

The TripalMap module provides a modernized user interface to display chromosomes of
different species and view pair-wise comparisons of known correspondences of genetic
map features. TripalMap integrates with Drupal websites using the Tripal API and Chado
tables from a PostgreSQL database.
